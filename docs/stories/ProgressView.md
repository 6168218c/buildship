# Progress View

## Provide a Build Progress View

### Requested Change

When running a build, show a new Build Progress View that visualizes the execution of the build. Show when the builds starts and
finishes, when the different phases of the build start and finish, when a task starts and finishes, and when tests start
and finish.

### Motivation

Showing the progress of the build execution provides the user with constant feedback. This helps the user understand what the
build has been doing. It also shows off some of the impressive things that Gradle is doing behind the scenes.
