# General

## Provide project/workspace settings

### Requested Change

Integrate into the workspace settings such that the user can define workspace-wide and project-specific settings, like
whether to show the Build Progress View when running a Gradle task.

### Motivation

Currently, the default behavior is either configured during the import of a project or some smart defaults are applied
by Buildship itself. It must also become possible for the user to actively control and override these configuration settings.
