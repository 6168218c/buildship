# General

## Provide help content

### Requested Change

Eclipse has an integrated help system which is also available online via http://help.eclipse.org. Buildship should also provide (at least) minimal help content to avoid that functionality is documented within the application, like currently for in the import wizard Gradle task.

### Motivation

Eclipse provides an integrated context sensitive help system which the users are used to. Buildship should follow the same convention.
