## ~~Refresh the configuration of an imported project~~

### Requested Change

Provide a context-menu item for project nodes that allows to refresh the project configuration of the multi-project to which
the selected project belongs. Refreshing the project configuration is basically a re-import of the project, with detection if
something has actually changed before applying the change.

### Motivation

There needs to be a way to manually refresh the project configuration when parts of the underlying build change.
