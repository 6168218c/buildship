# Plugins View

## Provide a Plugins View

### Requested Change

Display the plugins that have been applied to each project in a tree-like structure. For each plugin, display the id, the version, and the origin.

### Motivation

It is useful information to know what plugins are applied to a given project. The information that is displayed for each plugin can be extended in
future versions of Buildship.
